                <p>
                    Welcome to ShoLC. This Privacy Policy describes the policies and procedures of ShoLC,
                    Inc. (“ShoLC”, “we” or “us”) on the collection, use, security and disclosure of personal information
                    about
                    you
                    on https://sho.lc (the “Site”) and the services, features, content or applications offered by ShoLC
                    (collectively with the Site, the “Services”). It also describes your choices regarding use,
                    access and correction of your personal information.
                </p>
                <h3 class="font-bold uppercase mt-3 mb-1">Scope</h3>
                <p>This Privacy Policy covers the treatment of the personal information gathered by ShoLC when you use
                    or access
                    the Services, or when you view or interact with a ShoLC link (either our bit.ly links of one of our
                    branded
                    domains). This Privacy Policy also covers ShoLC’s treatment of any information about you that
                    ShoLC’s
                    customers share with ShoLC.</p>

                <p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of other businesses that ShoLC does not own or
                    control,
                    including other companies’ websites, services and applications (“Third Party Services”) that you can
                    access
                    through the Services, such as Facebook or Twitter, or to individuals that ShoLC does not manage or
                    employ.
                    We cannot take responsibility for the content or privacy policies of those Third Party Services. We
                    encourage you to review the privacy policies of any Third Party Services you access.</p>
                <h3 class="font-bold uppercase mt-3 mb-1">Information We Collect</h3>
                <p> ShoLC may collect personal information about you as described in this Privacy Policy when you (i)
                    register
                    for the Site and the Services, through your user account with ShoLC, including registering through a
                    third-party social networking service (your “Account”), (ii) use the Services, or (iii) view or
                    interact
                    with a ShoLC link (either our bit.ly links or one of our branded domains) on a third-party website.
                    We
                    collect the following types of information from you, some of which might be considered personal
                    information
                    under applicable law.</p>

                <h3 class="font-bold uppercase mt-3 mb-1"> When You Register for a ShoLC Account</h3>
                <p>When you create an Account, we may collect personal information from you, such as your name, phone
                    number,
                    company name, industry, job title, company size and email address. If you create an Account using
                    your login
                    from a third-party account, such as Google, Facebook or Twitter, we will access and collect the
                    personal
                    information about you that the third-party account provides (which is based on your privacy settings
                    with
                    the third-party account), so that you can log into your Account with us. We use your contact
                    information to
                    send you information about our Services and communicate with you about your Account, your activities
                    on our
                    Site and Services and policy changes. You may unsubscribe from receiving certain types of these
                    messages
                    through your Account settings, although ShoLC reserves the right to contact you when we believe it
                    is
                    necessary, such as for administrative and account management purposes.</p>

                <p>Some features of the Services allow registered users to provide their own content to the Services,
                    such as
                    written descriptions of URLs, comments, images and video. Unless you request deletion of your
                    personal
                    information as described in this Privacy Policy, all content submitted by you to the Services may be
                    retained by ShoLC, even after you terminate your Account and may continue to be shared by third
                    parties, as
                    described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

                <h3 class="font-bold uppercase mt-3 mb-1">When You Create a ShoLC Link</h3>
                <p>One feature of the Services is the ability to create shortened uniform resource locators (URLs) of
                    websites
                    (“ShoLC Link” or “Bitlinks”). Users can create ShoLC Links without registering for an account. When
                    you
                    create a ShoLC Link, ShoLC collects and stores both the original URL and the shortened URL and, if
                    you are
                    logged in to your Account, we will associate that information with your Account. ShoLC also collects
                    and
                    stores your IP address, your location, which we derive from your IP address, the time and date on
                    which you
                    shortened the original URL, and if you share a ShoLC Link on a social networking platform, the name
                    of the
                    platform and your username on that platform.</p>

                <h3 class="font-bold uppercase mt-3 mb-1">When You Interact With a ShoLC Link</h3>
                <p>ShoLC automatically collects personal information about the interaction (such as clicks or views)
                    with every
                    ShoLC Link created through the Services (either our bit.ly links or one of our branded domains) on a
                    third-party website. This information includes, but is not limited to: (i) the IP address and
                    location
                    derived from the IP address; (ii) the referring websites or services; (iii) the time and date of
                    each
                    access; (iv) device settings, such as browser type, operating system, and language; (v) cookies, as
                    described below, and mobile advertising identifiers and (v) information about sharing of the ShoLC
                    Link on
                    Third Party Services such as Twitter and Facebook (collectively, “ShoLC Link Metrics”). As described
                    in this
                    policy, we use ShoLC Link Metrics to provide the Services, to understand and analyze how our
                    Services are
                    used and to identify trends, and to detect, deter and prevent malicious, fraudulent or unlawful
                    activity.
                    Please see the “Information We May Share” section of this Privacy Policy for a description of how we
                    may
                    share information we collect when you create, view or interact with ShoLC Links.</p>

                <h3 class="font-bold uppercase mt-3 mb-1">Other Information We Automatically Collect</h3>
                <p>When you visit the Site, we automatically collect (i) your IP address and location derived from the
                    IP
                    address; (ii) the referring websites or services; (iii) the time and date of each access; (iv)
                    device
                    settings, such as browser type, operating system, and language; and (v) cookie information. This
                    type of
                    data enables us and third parties authorized by us to figure out how often individuals use parts of
                    the Site
                    so that we can analyze and improve them.</p>

                <p>We may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. We use this confirmation to improve our
                    customer service.</p>

                <p>ShoLC may use third-party APIs and software development kits (“SDKs”) to provide certain functions in
                    our
                    Services.</p>

                <h3 class="font-bold uppercase mt-3 mb-1">Third Party Services</h3>
                <p>Some features of the Services allow you to share your content and ShoLC Links through your accounts
                    with
                    other companies such as Facebook and Twitter. If you choose to connect ShoLC to such Third Party
                    Services,
                    we may collect information related to your use of those Third Party Services, such as authentication
                    tokens
                    that allow us to connect to your Third Party Service accounts. We will ask you for permission before
                    you
                    authorize our collection of this information. We will only use that information for the specific
                    reason for
                    which it was provided to us. We may also collect information about how you are using the Services to
                    interact with those connected Third Party Services. Note that Third Party Services may have the
                    ability to
                    restrict the information that is provided to us based on your privacy settings of that account.</p>

                <p>To enable us to infer the location from the IP addresses of computers or devices that visit our
                    website or
                    click, view or interact with ShoLC links as described in this policy, we receive IP-based location
                    information from our third-party service provider. We also receive business contact information of
                    our
                    business customer contacts and prospects from our third party service provider.</p>

                <h3 class="font-bold uppercase mt-3 mb-1">Cookies and Other Similar Technologies</h3>
                <p>ShoLC and its partners use cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the website,
                    track
                    users’ movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a
                    whole.</p>

                <p>Cookies are pieces of text that may be provided to your computer through your web browser when you
                    access a
                    website. Your browser stores cookies in a manner associated with each website you visit. We use
                    cookies to
                    enable our servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you visit our Site and use
                    the
                    Services through the web.</p>

                <p>ShoLC cookies also allow ShoLC to track when you have clicked on a ShoLC Link. Each click of a ShoLC
                    Link is
                    tracked using a unique identifier assigned to you in one or more cookies stored by your web browser
                    and
                    associated with ShoLC. We may associate the unique identifier in our cookies with the other
                    information we
                    automatically collect when you use the Services, as described above, including your IP address,
                    ShoLC Links
                    you click, ShoLC Links you create, and information with your Account if you have one.</p>

                <p>Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from
                    accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software)
                    allowing you to
                    decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. If you disable cookies, you will not
                    be able
                    to use some features of the Services.</p>

                <p>We partner with third parties to track utilization and behavior on our websites, display advertising
                    on our
                    websites, and to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third-party partners may use cookies,
                    web
                    beacons, pixel tags or similar technologies in order to provide you advertising based upon your
                    browsing
                    activities and interests. If you wish to opt out of interest-based advertising click here or if
                    located in
                    the European Union click here.</p>

                <p>This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by ShoLC only and does not cover the use of cookies by
                    any
                    Third Party Services. ShoLC does not control when or how third parties place cookies on your
                    computer, such
                    as when you visit the website from a ShoLC Link. You can manage other companies’ cookies used for
                    online
                    advertising by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Choice Page.</p>

                <h3 class="font-bold uppercase mt-3 mb-1">Opt-Out Mechanisms</h3>
                <p>You may ask ShoLC not to associate your web browser or IP address with visits to the ShoLC.com
                    website or
                    ShoLC Links that you create or click by clicking on the appropriate links below. If you would like
                    to
                    opt-out of the ShoLC Links, please click on the opt-out choice for ShoLC Links below. This will
                    install a
                    cookie on your browser that instructs our servers not to associate your IP address and browser with
                    ShoLC
                    Links you create, click or view. If you clear your cookies in your browser, you will need to click
                    on the
                    opt-out choice again after each time you clear your cookies. To be clear, these cookie-based
                    opt-outs must
                    be performed on each device and browser that you wish to have opted-out. Cookie-based opt-outs are
                    not
                    effective on mobile applications. However, on many mobile devices, application users may limit
                    tracking via
                    their device settings. Please note that if you use these opt-out mechanisms, will still
                    automatically
                    collect the IP addresses of computers or mobile devices that click on or create ShoLC Links; we just
                    won’t
                    associate them with your browser or ShoLC account.</p>

                <h3 class="font-bold uppercase mt-3 mb-1">Note Regarding Children</h3>
                <p>We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we learn that we have collected
                    personal
                    information of a child under 13 (or older as required by applicable law), we will take steps to
                    delete such
                    information from our files as soon as possible.</p>

                <h3 class="font-bold uppercase mt-3 mb-1">How We Use Information</h3>
                <p>We use the personal information we collect for a variety of administrative and business purposes
                    to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> operate our Site and provide the Services,</li>
                    <li> process and complete any transactions,</li>
                    <li> verify individual identity,</li>
                    <li> respond to inquiries, questions and comments and provide customer and technical support,</li>
                    <li> provide access to certain functionalities of our Services,</li>
                    <li> personalize and improve the Services and develop new products and services,</li>
                    <li> to communicate with our current and prospective customers concerning our services,</li>
                    <li> measure interest and engagement in our Site and Services,</li>
                    <li> monitor and analyze usage and trends of the Site and Services,</li>
                    <li> provide services to our customers to allow them to understand how you interact with our
                        Services and to
                        help detect, deter and prevent malicious, fraudulent or unlawful activity,
                    </li>
                    <li> comply with any legal obligations, and</li>
                    <li> enforce our terms and as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="font-bold uppercase mt-3 mb-1">Usage Across Devices</h3>
                <p>We may use the information we collect to make inferences that a unique individual has created or
                    interacted
                    with ShoLC links on different devices so that we can to detect, deter and prevent malicious,
                    fraudulent or
                    unlawful activity and analyze how users use our Services. For example, if you created a ShoLC link
                    on a
                    computer connected to your residential WiFi network, and you soon thereafter clicked on a ShoLC link
                    on a
                    mobile device connected to the same WiFi network, we may infer that a single individual created and
                    clicked
                    on the ShoLC links because both events were associated with the same IP address in the same time
                    period.</p>

                <h3 class="font-bold uppercase mt-3 mb-1">Other Legitimate Interests</h3>
                <p>We also may use personal information to pursue legitimate interests, such as direct marketing,
                    research
                    (including marketing research), network and information security, prevention of fraudulent,
                    malicious and
                    unlawful activities, or any other purpose disclosed to you at the time you provide personal
                    information or
                    allowed by law.</p>

                <h3 class="font-bold uppercase mt-3 mb-1">Information We Share</h3>
                <p>The Services are designed to help you share information with others. In addition, we provide Services
                    to our
                    Customers that use ShoLC Link Metrics. As a result, some of the personal information generated
                    through your
                    use of the Services is shared publicly or with third parties as described below.</p>

                <h3 class="font-bold uppercase mt-3 mb-1">ShoLC Links You Create</h3>
                <p>Much of your activity on and through the Services is public by default. For example, when you create
                    a ShoLC
                    Link, the original URLs you have shortened and the corresponding ShoLC Links are publicly
                    available.</p>

                <h3 class="font-bold uppercase mt-3 mb-1">Account Information</h3>
                <p>Where permitted by law, if you register a ShoLC Account with an email address on a domain owned by an
                    organization, (for example, an employer or educational institution where you have an email account),
                    we may
                    share your email address and information about your Account, such as the number of links you have
                    created,
                    with that organization to explore the organization’s interest in creating or managing an enterprise
                    account
                    or for related purposes.</p>

                <h3 class="font-bold uppercase mt-3 mb-1">Information We Share With Customers</h3>
                <p>We may share the personal information we collect as described in this Privacy Policy with our
                    customers. When
                    you create a ShoLC Link of one of our enterprise customer’s sites, the enterprise customer is able
                    to view
                    the unshortened original URL, the date and time the ShoLC Link was created, the location where it
                    was
                    created as derived from your IP address, and aggregated information about clicks and views of the
                    ShoLC
                    Links, including the number of times the ShoLC Link was shared, whether or not it was viewed,
                    comparison of
                    that ShoLC Links performance to that of all ShoLC Links pointing to the same content, whether others
                    are
                    sharing a ShoLC Link to the same content, geographic regions where the content is being viewed, and
                    identification of social networks on which the ShoLC Links appear. In addition, we may share ShoLC
                    Link
                    Metrics with customers to help them detect, deter and prevent malicious, fraudulent or unlawful
                    activity.</p>

                <h3 class="font-bold uppercase mt-3 mb-1">Information You Elect to Share</h3>
                <p>When creating a ShoLC Link, you can share that ShoLC Link through Third Party Services. Any
                    information that
                    you elect to distribute through Third Party Services, such as a social network post you create, may
                    then
                    become accessible to users of those services. You can also access other Third Party Services through
                    the
                    Services, for example by clicking on links in the Statistics page for a ShoLC Link. We recommend
                    that you
                    review the terms of services and privacy policies of such Third Party Services that you access
                    through the
                    Services since ShoLC does not control and is not responsible for the privacy practices of these
                    Third Party
                    Services.</p>

                <h3 class="font-bold uppercase mt-3 mb-1">Information Shared with Service Providers</h3>
                <p>We may employ and contract with third parties to perform certain tasks on our behalf and under our
                    direction
                    (our “Service Providers”). We may need to share information about you with our Service Providers in
                    order to
                    provide our product with research and analytics on user behavior and to provide advertising products
                    and
                    services to users, to process payments, and to provide email marketing and support services. Our
                    agreements
                    with these Service Providers authorize them to use your information only as necessary to provide
                    services to
                    us. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the service agreements with our
                    Clients.</p>

                <h3 class="font-bold uppercase mt-3 mb-1">Information Disclosed Pursuant to Business Transfers</h3>
                <p>We may transfer and/or provide information about our users in connection with an acquisition, sale of
                    company
                    assets, or other situation where user information would be transferred as one of our business
                    assets. You
                    will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our website.</p>

                <p>In such a case, the acquirer of ShoLC may continue to use your information as set forth in this
                    policy or as
                    otherwise allowed by law.</p>

                <h3 class="font-bold uppercase mt-3 mb-1">Information Disclosed for the Protection of ShoLC and Others</h3>
                <p>ShoLC may access, read, preserve, and disclose any information it collects when it has a good faith
                    belief
                    that doing so is reasonably necessary to (i) comply with a law, regulation, or compulsory legal
                    request,
                    including process from a governmental law enforcement or national security agency, (ii) enforce the
                    Privacy
                    Policy or Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations hereof, (iii) detect,
                    deter,
                    prevent or otherwise address malicious, fraudulent or unlawful activity, (iv) respond to user
                    support
                    requests, or (v) protect the rights, property or safety of ShoLC, its users and the public. This
                    includes
                    exchanging information with other companies and organizations for protection from malicious,
                    fraudulent or
                    unlawful activity.</p>

                <h3 class="font-bold uppercase mt-3 mb-1">Information We Share With Your Consent</h3>
                <p>We will share information about you when you instruct us to do so, such as when you share ShoLC Links
                    or
                    content with others through the Services or if we notify you that the information you provide will
                    be shared
                    in a particular manner and you provide such information (like sharing/posting it with a third-party
                    Service).</p>

                    from
                    European Economic Area (EEA) member countries and Switzerland, respectively, in reliance on each

                <p>ShoLC, Inc. is responsible for the processing of personal data it receives, under each Privacy Shield
                    Framework, and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. ShoLC, Inc.
                    complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of personal data from the EEA

                <h3 class="font-bold uppercase mt-3 mb-1">Retention</h3>
                <p>We retain the personal information we receive as described in this Privacy Policy for as long as you
                    use our
                    Services or as necessary to fulfill the purpose(s) for which it was collected, provide our Services,

                    disputes, establish legal defenses, conduct audits, pursue legitimate business purposes, enforce our
                    agreements, and comply with applicable laws.</p>

                <h3 class="font-bold uppercase mt-3 mb-1">Information Security</h3>
                <p>Your Account information is protected by a password for your privacy and security. You can prevent
                    unauthorized access to your Account by selecting and protecting your password appropriately, making
                    use of
                    two-factor authentication, and limiting access to your computer and browser by signing off after you
                    have
                    finished accessing your Account.</p>

                <p>ShoLC endeavors to protect the information it collects about its users using industry-standard
                    security
                    processes and controls, however, despite these efforts, no security measure is perfect or
                    impenetrable and
                    ShoLC does not guarantee or warrant that such measures will prevent unauthorized access to the
                    information
                    about you that is stored by ShoLC. In the event we experience a breach of security, we will promptly
                    notify
                    you if your personal information has been compromised, in accordance with applicable law. If you
                    have any
                    questions about the security of your personal information, you can contact us at support@sho.lc.</p>

                <h3 class="font-bold uppercase mt-3 mb-1">Choice and Access</h3>
                <p>You don’t need an Account to create ShoLC Links, and you can use many of the features of the Services
                    without
                    registering, thereby limiting the type of information that is collected about you individually.</p>

                <p>ShoLC acknowledges that you have the right to access your personal information that we collect and
                    are able
                    to associate with you. If you have a ShoLC Account, you may access, correct, or request deletion of
                    your
                    personal information by logging into your Account. Once logged in to your account, you will be able
                    to view
                    a history of the URLs you have shortened and the metrics pages for those URLs. You can request a
                    complete
                    copy of the personal information we store about your account by clicking the Request GDPR SAR Report
                    button
                    in your Account Settings. For more information on how to request access to your information, please
                    see our
                    help article. You can delete your Account at any time through your Account settings page. If you
                    delete your
                    Account, you will no longer be able to access or use the Services. If you have an Account but are
                    unable to
                    access it, you can contact us at support@sho.lc. We will respond to your request within a reasonable
                    timeframe. If you are a resident of the EEA or Switzerland, you have the right to ask that your
                    personal
                    data be corrected, updated, or erased. You may also have the right to object to, or request that we
                    restrict, certain processing. If you would like to exercise any of these rights, you may contact us
                    as
                    indicated in the “Questions” section below. In certain circumstances, we may be required by law to
                    retain
                    your personal information.</p>

                <p>If you do not have a ShoLC account, ShoLC has no way of identifying you or verifying that you created
                    or
                    clicked on a ShoLC link.</p>

                <p>Please note that in the interest of ensuring that existing ShoLC Links continue to function for all
                    of our
                    users, the ShoLC Links that you have created and shared cannot be deleted or disabled (even if your
                    Account
                    is deleted), and any shortening and sharing activity that has already occurred on your Account also
                    cannot
                    be deleted. If you have concerns about any unauthorized use of your Account, you can delete your
                    account
                    within your Account settings.</p>

                    the Privacy Policy when you use the Services after those changes become effective.</p>
